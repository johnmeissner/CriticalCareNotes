# Heart Tones


| Heart Tone | Location | Cause |
| ---------- | -------- | ----- |
| S1 | Loudest in the mitral area, using the diaphragm | Normal |
| Split S1 | Between the apex of the heart and the sternum, usually during expiration, using the diaphragm | May be normal, nonsynchronous closing of mitral and tricuspid valves or pathologic, such as in a bundle branch block, an atrial septal defect, or pulmonary stenosis |
| S2 | Loudest in the aortic area, using the diaphragm | Normal |
| Split S2 | Loudest in the pulmonic area, usually on inspiration, using the diaphragm | May be normal, nonsynchronous closing of aortic and pulmonic, such as in hypertension |
| S3/Ventriular Gallop | Heard in early diastole just after the S2; may be heard at the apex or at the left sternal border; loudest on expiration with the patient in the lateral position, using the bell of the stethoscope | Always abnormal; indicates ventricular filling, May be normal in children and young adults or seen in diseases such as mitral valve regurgitation, hyperthyroidism, and CHF |
| S4/Atrial Gallop | Heard late in diastole just before S1, at the apex or over the suprasternal notch; heard best with the bell | May be normal (children and young adults); indiates increased resistance to ventricular filling after the atrial contraction; often seen after a MI |
| Systolic Murmur | Turbulent blood flow through the valves of the heart, during systole, using the diaphragm; location depends on the cause | May be normal or seen with aortic or pulmonic stenosis ; or mitral or tricuspid regurgitation |
| Diastolic Murmur | Turbulent blood flow through the valves of the heart, during systole, using the diaphragm; location depends on the cause | Always abnormal; seen with mitral or tricuspid stenosis, or aortic or pulmonic regurgitation |
| Pericardial friction rub | Scratchy, high-pitched sound heard throughout the cardiac cycle; best heard with the patient leaning forward, at the third intercostal space to the left of the sternum, using the diaphragm | Often present in pericarditis |
