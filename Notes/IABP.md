# Intra-Aortic Balloon Pump

* Cath inserted femorally
* Rests just below the aortic arch and above the renal arteries
* Helps afterload by pumping Helium into a baloon that is inflated during diastole and deflated just prior to systole
* Pump has to have contact with an Art line and EKG leads.  Removing either could cause systemic failure
* Balloon could tear due to calcemic buildup.  If you notice blood in the drive line; this is indicative of balloon or line failure.
* IABP can only be in standby for 20min.  Any longer and the risk for emboli is to great.
* Timing mode set 1:2
* Timed to inflate at the dicrotic notch (aortic valve closing)
