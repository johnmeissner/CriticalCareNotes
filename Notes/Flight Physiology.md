# Flight Physiology

## Atmospheric Zones
1. Physiologic Zone
 - Sea level to 10,000 Feet
 - Human Body is adapted to this zone
 - Barometric pressure drops from 760mmHg to 485mmHg
 - Non pressurized aircraft operate safely
2. Physiologically Deficient Zone
 - 10,000 to 50,000 Feet
 - Most commercial aviation occurs in this zone
 - Human survival in this zone depends on supplemental oxygen
 - Barometric pressure drops to 87mmHg in this zone
3. Partial Space Equivalent Zone
 - 50,000 Feet to 120 Miles
 - Similar to space
 - Pressurized suits required
 - Changes in gravity affect bodies
4. Space Equivalent Zone
 - Above 120 miles
 - Pressurized suits required
 - =Weightlessness
 - "Outer Space"

## Nine Stresses of Flight
1. Hypoxia
  * Hypoxic Hypoxia
     - No oxygen in environment
  * Hypemic Hypoxia
     - No oxygen in Blood
  * Stagnant Hypoxia
     - No blood flow
  * Histotoxic hypoxia
     - Red blood cell has a different molecule attached
2. Barometric Pressure
3. Thermal
4. Gravitational Forces
5. Noise
6. Vibration
7. Third Spacing
8. Decreased Humidity
9. Fatigue

## TUC
### Time of Useful Conciousness

| Altitude | Time |
| -------- | ---- |
|12-20 | 20-30 min |
|25    |3-5 min |
|20    |1-2 |

## EPT
### Effective Performance Time

| Altitude | EPT Standart Ascent | EPT Sudden Decompression |
| -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 18,000 Ft | 20-30 min | 10-15 min|
| 22,000 Ft | 8-10 min | 5 min |
| 25,000 Ft | 4-6 min | 1.5-3.5 min |
| 35,000 Ft | 30-60 sec | 15-30 sec |
| 43,000 Ft | 9-12 sec | 5 sec |
| >50,000 Ft | 9-12 sec| 5 sec|
