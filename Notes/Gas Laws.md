# Gas Laws

## Boyle's Law
* At a constant temperature, a given volume of gas is inversely proportional to the pressure surrounding the gas
* A volume of gas expands as the pressure surrounding the gas is reduced
* P1 X P2 = P2 X V2 or V2=(P1V1)/P2

## Henry's Law
* The amount of gas in solution is proportional to the partial pressure of that gas over the solution
* As the pressure of the gas above a solution increases, the amount of that gas dissolved in the solution increases
* S1/P1=S2/P2

## Charles' Law
* The pressure of the gas is directly proportional to its temperature with the volume remaining constant
* Temperature increases make gas molecules move faster, and greater force is exerted and volume expands
* V1/T1=V2/T2

## Dalton's Law
* Dexcribes the pressure exerted by a gas at various altiudes
* oxygen at sea level
* O2=21% and PO2 = 21% X 760mmHg = 159.22mmHg

## Graham's Law
* Law of gaseous diffusion
* Gases diffuse from higer concentration to lower concentration until equilibrium is achieved
