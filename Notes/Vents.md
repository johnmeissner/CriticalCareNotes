# Vents

### Vent Table

| Name | Description | Settings/Normal |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| Peep | Positive End Expiratory Pressure | Normal 5-8cm/H2O |
|PIP   |Peak Inspiratory Pressure   |   |
|Pplat   | Plateau Pressure  | <30 no bigger than 35 |
|TPP   | Transpulmonary Pressure  |   |
|V   | Tidal Volume  | 6-8mL/KG of Ideal Body Weight |
|I:E   | Inspiratory Expiratory Ratio  |   |
|FiO2   | Fraction of Inspired Oxygen  |   |



#### Minute Ventilation
- Minute Ventilation = tidal volume (L) * Respiratory Rate
- Describes how much gas is moved in a minute
- 9L (Minute Ventilation) = 0.5L (Tidal Volume in Liters) * 18 (Respiratory Rate)

#### ARDSnet Protocols
- Low tidal volumes
- Increase peep rather than FiO2
- Consider increasing sedation to promote synchrony with ventilator.

##### PS=difference of ipap (inspitory Pressure) and epap (PEEP)
- greater the ps greater the air movement.  Oxygenation vs ventilation issue.

## Vent Modes

### Assist Control Volume
- A set tidal volume is delivered at a minum rate
- Additional breaths are given if triggered by the pt.
### Assist Control Pressure
- A set tidal Pressure is delivered at a minum rate
- Additional breaths are given if triggered by the pt.
### Pressure Support
- The pt controls the respiratory rate and exerts a major influence on the duration of inspiration, inspitory flow rate, and tidal volume.
- The model provides pressure support to overcome the increased work of breathing imposed by the disease process, the ET tube, inspiratory valves, and other mechanical aspects of ventilatory support.
### SimV Volume
- Breaths are given at a set minimal rate, however if th pt chooses to breath over the set rate no additional support is given.
### SimV Pressure
### PRVC
- Pressure Regulated Volume Control
- ACVC+
- Hybrid Mode
- Set like a volume control mode
- As the vent works with the pt it adjusts pressure and volume until it deliveres a volume at the lowest pressure it can.
