# Sepsis
## Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome
### Gregory Richburg M.D.


#### Types of Immunity
- Innate
  *
- Aquired


#### Types of Cells

#### SIRS Criteria
##### Meets two or more of the following
- Temp >38C or <36C
- Heart Rate > 90BPM
- RR > 20bpm or a PaCO2 < 32 mmHg
- WBC > 12,000 cell/mm^3 or < 4,000 cells/mm^3 or > 10% immature band forms
-
Bacteremia does not necessarily denote Sepsis; however, if left untreated it can potentially decline to Sepsis

#### BUFALO
1. Blood cultures
2. Urin output/cultures
3. Fluid
4. Antibiotics
5. Lactate and H&H
6. Oxygen

#### Flow of Sepsis

1. SIRS Criteria Met
2. Sepsis
  - SIRS Criteria met with infection
3. Severe Sepsis
  - Sepsis with >/= 1 sign of organ failure
4. Septic Shock
  - SIRS + Infection + Organ Failure + Hypotension

#### MODS
##### Multi Organ Dysfunction Syndrome

- When 2 or more systems demonstrate signs of hypoperfusion
- Co-Morbidities
  - CAD
  - Diabetes
  - Renal Disease
  - Invasive Devices
  - Immonucompromised Pts
  - Untreated Infections
  - Extremes of Age
- Assess for risk of MODS
  - Qsofa Score
    - RR > 22
    - AMS
    - Systolic BP < 100 mmHg
- Management
  - Early fluid resus
    - 30ml/kG of crystalloid within 3 hours
    - Fluid resus after is directed at targeting a MAP of 65 mmHg
  - Early broad spectrum antibiotic
    - Within one hour of recognition
  - Pressors
    - Levophed initally
    - Dopamine associated with increased mortality
