# Hemodynamic Monitoring

## Types of Catheters

### Swan -Gnaz/Gantz/Ganz Catheter
          (     ^        )
        (Depending on Slide)
* Fill balloon to 1-1.5mL for PAWP
* Inserted (<Incerted according to PP Slide) around 76 cm
* Normal Pressures
  - RAP 2-5mmHg
  - RV 25/5mmHg
  - PA 25/5mmHg
  - PAWP 8-12mmHg
* Depending where PA catheter is placed it can cause ventricular irritability
* Transducers
  - Distal Port (Yellow)
  - Proximal Port (Blue)
* Problem Solving
  - Check for air in transducer line
  - Deflate balloon on PA catheter
  - Assess pt condition change
  - Note waveform in relationship to cath position
  - Check Power Source
  - Check for loose connectors
  - Aspirate from line
  - Check stop-cocks in line
* If cath is removed
  - Don't leave in RV
    - Contact MD
  - Should not bleed if swan is DC'd
  - Not sterile without obstructor
#### Types
* Thermodilution
* VIP Thermodilution
* Paceport Thermodilution
* Oximetric Thermodilution

### Arterial line
* Typically Radial
